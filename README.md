📺 TV Show Dashboard
A Vue 3 application that allows users to browse and explore TV shows by genre, rating, and name using the TVMaze API.

🧱 Architectural Decisions
Vue 3 was chosen for its simplicity, reactivity, and modern tooling with Composition API support. It allows quick prototyping and clean separation of components.

Component-based architecture ensures scalability and reusability (e.g., reusable AppButton).

Jest is used for unit testing to ensure code reliability.

GitHub Pages is used for quick deployment and sharing.
